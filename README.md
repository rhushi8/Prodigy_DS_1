Problem Statement:Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

There was no compulsion for using the given dataset so I used the dataset of Employees which gives the education,age,gender,was the employee ever benched,etc.The link for the dataset is as follows- Dataset

From this task I have acquired the knowledge how to use PowerBi-a data visualization tool,along with it I understood how to plot the continuous and categorical variables in a graph.
In the output I have provided the distribution of 

1)Count of employees based on age that were benched
This provides us the insights regarding employees of which age group were benches the most.

2)Count of employees in different cities based on their education.
This provides the insights regarding what was the count of employees of different education backgrounds in the three cities mentioned in the dataset.
